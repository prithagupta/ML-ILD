This package is able to automatically test detect Information Leakage in a system that generated binary classification datasets.
Installation
------------
The latest release version of CS-Rank can be installed from Github as follows::
	
	pip install git+https://github.com/prithagupta/ML-ILD.git

Another option is to clone the repository and install PY-SCA using::

	python setup.py install


Dependencies
------------
MI-ILD depends on NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, joblib and tqdm. For data processing and generation you will also need and pandas.
